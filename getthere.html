            <h2>How To Get To San Sperate From Cagliari (and back again)</h2>
            <p>There are a few details to know about going to San Sperate. Here's a quick 8 step  <br>
               guide: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start at Cagliari bus station, next to the train station.</li>
                <li>Take bus number 112 to San Sperate. It should be around 30 minutes to get there. (Schedules available on Arst Sardegna website, the bus company)</li>
                <li>You can buy a ticket in the machines, but for certain reasons, we'll get the app DropTicket to buy our ticket. </li>
                <li>Buy a ticket in the app, but don't activate it until it's time to go. </li>
                <li>Show it to the driver, no problems. </li>
                <li>You should get off roughly on the main road (Via Cagliari), and make your way from there to the Tourist Office (blue marker on map). If in season, <br>
                    you can choose to get the audio guide, and grab some other brochures with maps and such. If not in season, the office is officially closed, but I <br>
                    found a custodian outside who was willing to open the office so I could get some brochures. There's also supposedly a QR code system that can give <br>
                     you information, but it was found not working off season. (Dec. 2024)</li>
                <li>When you've seen everything you want to see, make your way to the bus stop  (white marker). It's next to the mural of the mask on the main road. </li>
                <li>You can now just buy a ticket in the app, and go back to Cagliari, same procedure as before.</li>

            </ol>

            <p>So, why the song and dance with the app? Well, you can't buy tickets on the bus, and there are no machines in San Sperate, so you wouldn't be able to <br>
                buy a ticket, except for certain stores you need to know. However, bus drivers have been known to let tourists on the bus back to Cagliari <br>
                without a ticket (July 2024).</p>
