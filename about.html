            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Peter. I'm 38 years old, and I live in <br>
                Denmark. I'm  studying Multimedia Design, which <br>
                is what has led me to do this website. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                It came to be, because we had to do a project <br>
                under the heading “Hidden Places”, and I was <br>
                quickly reminded of a small town in Sardinia <br>
                that I had visited in July 2024 called San <br>
                Sperate. I had been told of its existence by a <br>
                local Italian I befriended, who thought it would <br>
                be a nice place to visit for someone with an <br>
                interest in art. He was very much right in <br>
                thinking so. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                People from neighboring Cagliari are aware of <br>
                 the town, and partially throughout Sardinia, <br>
                 but otherwise it remains mostly unknown <br>
                 amongst other Italians. <br>
                
                Naturally, it is even less well known in the <br>
                English speaking world, so if possible, I hope <br>
                to maybe spread the word and make it more known <br>
                throughout the world. </p>

            <h2>About San Sperate</h2>
        
                <p> In 1968, through the efforts of local artist Pinuccio <br>
                Sciola and other local contributors and participants, <br>
                a project was envisioned to turn the town of San Sperate <br>
                into a so-called “town museum”, an open air art museum. </p>
                <p>
                From then and until now, local and foreign artists have made  <br>
                sculptures, installations and of course murals throughout the  <br>
                town, and according to local informants, more are constantly  <br>
                being added to enrich the artful atmosphere of the town.  <br>
